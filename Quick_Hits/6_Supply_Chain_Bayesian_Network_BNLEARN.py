Bayesian Network for Supply Chain Risk Mitigation using BNLearn
---

üîç **Situation**:
- Determine the causal relationships between various factors in a supply chain to estimate the risk of disruptions.
- Use Bayesian Networks to model the dependencies between supplier delays, inventory levels, production delays, demand surges, and customer delays.

üìå **Task**:
- Bayesian Networks (BNs)
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables, and edges represent causal or probabilistic dependencies.
- Uses Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) to define relationships.
- Ideal for causal modeling, decision support, and prediction.
- Use case fit: ‚úÖ Best for supply chain risk estimation because disruptions often follow a causal chain (e.g., raw material shortages ‚Üí production delays ‚Üí supplier failure).
- PGMPY also supports Markov Networks but follow undirect graphs that do not have causal relationship - not as good for supply chain risk estimation.

‚ú® **Action**: 
- This library is best for fitting Bayesian Networks to data and performing causal inference. 

üìà **Result**:
- Compare BNLearn with PGMPY for Bayesian Network modeling on the same dataset.
