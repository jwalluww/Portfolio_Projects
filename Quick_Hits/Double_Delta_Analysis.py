Double Delta (Difference-in-Differences) Method for Loyalty Program Impact Analysis

üìå **Objective**:
- Measure the causal impact of a treatment on customer spending.
- Use the Double Delta (Difference-in-Differences) method to control for natural spending trends.
- Validate results using OLS regression.

üîç **Key Takeaways**:
- **Pre-Treatment Spending**: Average spending before the program for both groups.
- **Post-Treatment Spending**: Spending changes after the program.
- **Double Delta Effect**: The true treatment effect of the loyalty program, isolating organic spending trends.
- **Robustness Check**: Regression approach confirms statistical significance.

üìå **Methodology**:
1. **Simulate customer spending data** before and after the program.
2. **Compute Double Delta Effect**: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator.
3. **Run Regression for Robustness**:
   - Fit an **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model**: `spending ~ treatment * time`.
   - Validate statistical significance of treatment effects.

üìä **Interpretation**:
- **If the Double Delta Effect is positive**, the loyalty program increased spending.
- **If not significant**, the observed effect may be due to external factors.
