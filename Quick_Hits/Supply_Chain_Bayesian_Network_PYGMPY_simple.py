"""
Bayesian Network for Supply Chain Risk Mitigation using PGMPY

üìå **Objective**:
- Create a synthetic dataset for a retail pricing problem where we analyze the causal effects of a price change on customer demand
- Understand relationship between product price, advertising spend, competitor pricing, and customer demand

üîç **Key Takeaways**:
- **BLAH**: 
- **Next Steps**: 
    - 

üìå **Methodology**:
Bayesian Networks (BNs)

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables, and edges represent causal or probabilistic dependencies.
Uses Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) to define relationships.
Ideal for causal modeling, decision support, and prediction.
Use case fit: ‚úÖ Best for supply chain risk estimation because disruptions often follow a causal chain (e.g., raw material shortages ‚Üí production delays ‚Üí supplier failure).
PGMPY also supports Markov Networks but follow undirect graphs that do not have causal relationship - not as good for supply chain risk estimation.

# Key Insights from the CPTs
# Supplier Delay:

# 90% chance of no delay (Supplier_Delay = 0).
# 10% chance of a delay (Supplier_Delay = 1).
# This suggests that supplier reliability is high but not perfect.
# Inventory Levels (given Supplier Delay):

# If no Supplier Delay (Supplier_Delay = 0):
# High inventory: ~70%
# Medium inventory: ~20%
# Low inventory: ~9.7%
# If Supplier Delay occurs (Supplier_Delay = 1):
# High inventory drops significantly to 21%.
# Low inventory increases to 62%.
# Interpretation: Supplier delays reduce high inventory and increase low inventory.
# Production Delay (given Inventory Level):

# High inventory ‚Üí Very low chance of production delay (~98%)
# Low inventory ‚Üí Very high chance of production delay
# Interpretation: Production is heavily dependent on inventory levels.
# Customer Delay (given Demand Surge, Inventory, and Production Delay):

# Balanced 50%-50% probability in some cases, indicating a high uncertainty in final delays due to multiple interacting factors.
# If Production Delay = 1, Customer Delay increases significantly.
# If Demand Surge = 1, Customer Delay is more likely.
# Interpretation: Customer delays are primarily driven by inventory, production, and demand surges.
# Demand Surge:

# 87% chance of no demand surge.
# 13% chance of a demand surge.
# Interpretation: Most of the time, demand remains stable, but there‚Äôs a small chance of a spike.
