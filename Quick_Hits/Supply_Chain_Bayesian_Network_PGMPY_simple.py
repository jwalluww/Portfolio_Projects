Bayesian Network for Supply Chain Risk Mitigation using PGMPY

üìå **Objective**:
- Simple Bayesian Network to estimate supply chain risk using PGMPY.

üìÉ **Methodology**:
Bayesian Networks (BNs)

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables, and edges represent causal or probabilistic dependencies.
Uses Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) to define relationships.
Ideal for causal modeling, decision support, and prediction.
Use case fit: ‚úÖ Best for supply chain risk estimation because disruptions often follow a causal chain (e.g., raw material shortages ‚Üí production delays ‚Üí supplier failure).
PGMPY also supports Markov Networks but follow undirect graphs that do not have causal relationship - not as good for supply chain risk estimation.

üîç **Key Takeaways**:
- We can make inferences about the probability of events in a supply chain given observed data. 

üèπ **Next Steps**: 
- Extend the model to include more variables (e.g., transportation delays, natural disasters).
- More complex inferences (e.g., estimating the probability of multiple events occurring simultaneously).
