    "    We aimed to estimate the impact of an email marketing campaign on customer purchases.\n",
    "    Since this was an observational study where treatment assignment wasn’t randomized,\n",
    "    we needed to account for potential biases in the data to isolate the true effect of the campaign.\n",

    "📌 **Task**:\n",
    "    Our goal was to:\n",
    "        ✅ Estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) to measure the overall impact.\n",
    "        ✅ Use Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to compute the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) for customers who received the email.\n",
    "        ✅ Explore alternative methods such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) for further robustness.\n",

    "    Performed Propensity Score Matching (PSM):\n",

    "    Estimated Treatment Effects:\n",
    "        ✅ ATE — Compared mean purchase rates between treated and untreated groups.\n",
    "        ✅ ATT (Using PSM) — Measured the treatment effect on those who received the email.\n",

    "    ✅ ATE showed a slight negative effect, indicating the campaign had no overall uplift when measured across all users.\n",
    "    ✅ ATT (Using PSM) revealed a stronger positive effect for those who received the email, suggesting the campaign effectively targeted engaged customers.\n",
    "    ✅ ATU was minimal, confirming that non-recipients were unlikely to convert even if targeted.\n",
    "    ✅ CATE analysis revealed that higher-income and high-purchase-history segments responded most positively to the campaign.\n",
